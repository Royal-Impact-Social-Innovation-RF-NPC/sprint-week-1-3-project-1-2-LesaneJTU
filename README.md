# RBN_soil_moisture_detector_Project1-2_LR
Building and Coding a Soil Detector P1

This project is a low-cost soil moisture detector built with Arduino. It measures soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light, then displays the results on an LCD screen and uses LED indicators to signal soil water levels.

## Laser Cutting 
As part of my practice work, I explored laser cutting techniques to create custom casings and component holders. This exercise helped me gain hands-on experience with precision cutting, understanding material choices, and designing enclosures that improve both functionality and appearance of prototypes. It also gave me insight into how rapid fabrication tools can speed up iteration in hardware projects. I used CorelDraw to run the design that will be loaded to the machine.
